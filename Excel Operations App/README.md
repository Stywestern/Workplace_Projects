# Data Analysis & Reporting Suite

A modular Python desktop application designed to streamline data operations on Excel files. This tool provides a modern graphical interface for comparing datasets, detecting anomalies, and merging multiple data sources.

## 🚀 Key Features

The application is divided into specialized services:

* **Forecast Comparison (Service 1)**
    * Compares two Excel datasets based on a unique ID.
    * Aligns data and calculates difference and similarity percentages between forecast columns.
    * Groups data by "Subregion" (if available) for detailed granular reporting.

* **Data Change Detection (Service 2)**
    * Detects cell-level changes between two versions of a dataset.
    * Generates a highlighted Excel report showing exactly which values changed (e.g., `"Old Value → New Value"`).
    * Optimized to filter and display only the rows where changes occurred.

* **Anomaly Detection & Usage Reporting (Service 3)**
    * Analyzes time-series data to flag statistical anomalies in service usage.
    * Generates interactive HTML reports containing trend lines, bar charts, and detailed metrics.
    * Uses statistical thresholds to identify sustained shifts in data.

* **Excel Merger (Service 8)**
    * Merges multiple Excel files (or specific sheets) into a single master file.
    * Aligns data based on a user-selected key column.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **GUI Framework:** CustomTkinter
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, OpenPyXL
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib
* **Reporting:** Jinja2 (HTML Generation)
